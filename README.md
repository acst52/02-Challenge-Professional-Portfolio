# 02-Challenge-Professional-Portfolio

## Hello again!

Welcome to README file #2! Still not sure what these are supposed to contain!
In this very fun challenge, we built a portfolio page from scratch using only html & CSS. Nostalgic af!

## Building a Professional Portfolio Using only HTML & CSS
### Acceptance Criteria

Re: the acceptance criteria, you will notice that:
 
1. My portfolio displays my photo, name, a link to my CV, links to my future projects anchored around images, as well as a contact footer with links to linkedin, github (again), and a fake email and phone number.
2. When you click a nav link, the UI scrolls to the proper section.
3. The first application image is larger than the other two.
4. Clicking project images opens "projects" in a new tab.
5. The page has a responsive layout and looks good at all common viewport widths, achieved by using flex attributes and @media queries.

Below is the social preview when my deployed link is sent via IM:
